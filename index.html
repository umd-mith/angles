			<h1 id="head-copy">ANGLES is a research project aimed at developing a lightweight, online XML editor tuned to the needs of the scholarly text encoding community. <small>By combining the model of intensive code development (the “code sprint”) with participatory design exercises, testing, and feedback from domain experts gathered at disciplinary conferences, ANGLES will contribute not only a working prototype of a new software tool but also another model for tool building in the digital humanities (the “community roadshow”).</small></h1>
